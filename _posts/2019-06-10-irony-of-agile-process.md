*“Scrum is a framework, not a process!”* This had been drilled into my head for more than a decade and a half, thanks to my mentors. I am aware the current iteration of the [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/) now calls it a “process framework” (or “barely a process, only a framework” as per Ken Schwaber). However, the original point of the distinction, I feel, is even more important today. 

There are better blog posts out there that talks about the distinction in detail (e.g., [this post](https://guntherverheyen.com/2013/03/21/scrum-framework-not-methodology/)). Here's my short one: *Scrum is a "framework" because it intentionally leaves out a lot of blanks for its users to fill*. For example, it uses the term “Product Backlog Item” to make it generic enough so it can be, well, anything. It prescribes that product backlog items be estimated, but does not mention how. etc. 

And often, those gaps are filled with other Agile practices such as XP’s User Stories, Story Points and relative estimation, TDD, Connextra Format, or Kanban’s WIP limits and visualisation, etc. A lot of teams that use such Agile-practice-dense approach are quite successful. Though I would argue that those teams prone to doing XP practices are bound to be successful anyway because of who they are, rather than XP making them successful per se. That is, doing these practices take courage, passion, and dedication (they are quite eXtreme!). Almost totally opposite to adherence and compliance (maturity anyone?). Anyway...

There may had been some drama for a few years between the XP and Scrum camps on merging the two methods. But Scrum persisted and still leaned towards being less prescriptive. Still a framework and not a process! *Incomplete by design*. Whether it's good or bad in the long run, it stood its ground (or at least Jeff and Ken did).

## Just Enough Prescription

Which brings me back to why the distinction is relevant. As I’ve indicated [previously](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/turning-portfolio-management-its-head-mike-mallete/), my generalised definition of the whole Agile approach is this: "having team/s of people aligned to a common goal, empowered to do as they choose as best as they see fit to achieve that." The less prescriptions, the more gaps to fill. The more experiments the teams can do to fill voids, more learnings. And again, won't happen without empowerment.

Being conscious of course that, on the other hand, not enough prescription may also lead to chaos and not achieving anything practical. 

A framework like Scrum hits the balance. It is meant to help facilitate [self-management](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-lead-a-selfmanaging-team/) and the inspect-and-adapt cycle. It gives the team an environment to figure it out, rather than give them the exact steps to do so. We are not installing an operations manual here. Rather, we are building a culture of empowerment and learning.

## Hole-in-the-Floor

We are now in a world where we try to move whole organisations to this Agile philosophy, not just individual teams anymore. Scaling! Unfortunately, we have started seeing what the late great Gerarld Weinberg calls "hole-in-the-floor" approach in doing so. That is, somewhere at the top-floor of the building, new methods and processes are being cooked up by the higher-ups and highly-paid consultants. Then they drill a hole in the floor and drops this perfectly architected system which the workers downstairs happily catch and implement (figuratively of course!). Add in explicit control of the change process, then voila! 

And perhaps, you will get adherence and compliance to these "new agile ways of working" that's been cooked up upfront. Otherwise, you can measure each unit's "maturity" by seeing how close they are to the new process. And maybe it leads to success. It could be the case. But totally not the Agile that was promised.

## Build it up!

I learned this from LeSS (based on a book that totally escapes me): "Build it up vs. tailor it down." And this is in reference to people who are actually doing the work. Let them build up their practice (through actual learning from experience), rather than getting them to tailor down a big process imposed on them upfront. *Do impose very clear goals and boundaries that will ensure alignment at scale* (e.g., OKRs, common cadence, single product increment, etc.). But do give the space and resources for them to use their creative juices and experience to figure out how to work best together. Let the balance of just enough prescription ensure alignment, but *just enough gaps and contradictions to ensure better practices are emerging*. If you are actually telling them how to design their physical task boards to the exact detail, you are probably going a little overboard with your Agile Coaching.

## Agile is Culture, Not Process

*"Agile is culture, not process"* as per Jeff Patton's [post](https://www.jpattonassociates.com/agile-is-culture-not-process/). Ultimately, the Agile Method pins its hopes on "individuals and interactions over processes and tools." You can think "Framework" is somewhere in the middle of that statement. You have to reflect on whatever enablement, transformation, or adoption you are doing right now. Are you installing a process or are you building an Agile culture through frameworks?
