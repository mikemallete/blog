Last November 8, 2013, I had the privilege to be a speaker for the [inaugural Agile Singapore conference](http://2013.agilesingapore.org/). It was held at the awesome Marina Bay Sands and was two-fully-packed-days long. I had an awesome time interacting with the likes of Kent Beck, David Hussman, and the other great figures in the industry. Also had fun sharing and conversing not only with my colleagues at [Odd-e](http://odd-e.com), but also with the local Singaporean agile practitioners.

My talk was about an hour long. The room was quite full. It is mostly based on a talk I previously did at the [Agile2012 conference](http://agile2012.sched.org/event/9cc6d16a306da1035d034ff45129a403). Only this time, I opted to be more entertaining and packaged the whole talk as a business fable.

Without further ado, please head on to the generous media sponsor Infoqâ€™s website and get to see the recording of my talk.
