I summarise Agile leadership as this: *“Stop giving solutions to people. Give them clear outcomes to aspire to. Give them enough space and support. They will figure it out.”*

Nothing Earth-shattering. It’s no different to the military’s age-old “[Commander’s Intent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intent_(military)).” 

Most portfolio management schemes I’ve encountered are top-down management, coordination, and progress-tracking work. More mature ones have prioritisation, WIP-limits, and with strategic underpinnings in there as well. And probably, a lot of them probably work well in their context. 

However, they are still primarily solutions decided from up top, pushed down into the system. You will have portfolio managers deciding on “business and enabler epics.” Some use “Kanban boards” to track them. Push them down to the program and development teams. Maybe deliver as a train, maybe as a tribe. Track the solution delivery, or increment, or deliverable, etc. And maybe some KPIs here and there, preferably results focused rather than delivery-centric.

Management and monitoring of the work could also be top-down (or perhaps by external parties). Release/Solutions Train Engineers, Scrum-of-Scrum/Meta-Scrum Masters, etc. With the need for elaborate tracking and coordination tools (ready your Jira-fu!)

And again, they could be what is needed. 

Let me provide you with an alternative though. Allow me to push things a little more towards how I’ve defined Agile leadership.

There are two predominant layers here. The target outcomes, and the solutions (or to use Jeff Patton’s word, [output](https://vimeo.com/206617354)). 

Statoil’s Ambition-to-Action (see: [Beyond Budgeting](https://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Beyond-Budgeting-Unlocking-Performance/dp/0470405163)) comes to mind. Organisational ambitions are decided on and clarified up top, decisions on actions (and to an extent, forecasts) are pushed as deep into the system (for their case, up to individual level). Outcome targets decided at the top, while Solutions (or Output) decided by people who do the work. Awesome.

Let’s translate that to the example above. Imagine, Portfolio-level Management defining Strategic Outcomes (analogue to Ambition). Let’s say using OKRs as a tool. Gets their various programs, development teams, squads, tribes, etc. to look into it, formulate their own OKRs to support this one, and propose their own solutions to work towards them (equivalent to Action). Whether they propose in terms of epics, initiatives, roadmap, etc. it’s what will work for their situation.

Here, the solutions were proposed by the teams (and hence accountable). High-level management get to approve what they see connects well with the overall set objectives and the feasibility of the solution presented.

Being accountable to the solution, the teams then have all the reason to be responsible for keeping track of their work and coordinate with the appropriate people. I don’t see the need to push or prescribe any specific way of doing this. Rather, with some coaching, we can trust the teams will use what will work. It’s their solution!

Leadership responsibility then changes from keeping tabs and monitoring progress to making sure the people doing the work has everything they need to be successful. 

The Portfolio can have inspect-and-adapt cadences on how they are tracking with their OKRs. Then make adjustments should they see appropriate (e.g., change a roadmap, change the OKR, expand the work, etc.). Ultimately, success is measured by how close the group came to their ambition.

Money!....Not.

Definitely not perfect. But at the very least worth exploring.
