![Speaking at Agile Singapore 2013](/assets/images/about.jpg)

For more than a decade and a half, I had been in the software development industry wearing multiple hats, from software development, enterprise architecture, to organisational development and management. I had been involved in the travel industry for a good number of years, as well as telecommunications, banking, healthcare, and emerging industries during my consulting and Agile Coaching practice. 

The last 6 years, I had been helping organisations, from small start-ups to large multi-nationals, to adopt and transition to more modern and better ways of working. 

I am a [Certified Enterprise Coach](https://www.scrumalliance.org/certifications/cec-certification), first from Southeast Asia. I am also a Scrum Alliance Registered Education Provider Trainer. I have been co-training Certified Scrum Master courses since 2011. 

As an experienced software developer, I've contributed to various open source products starting early 2000's.

I have been a speaker in various international conferences such as those hosted by the Agile Alliance, Agile Tour, etc.

Originally from the Philippines, I am currently based in Sydney, Australia.
